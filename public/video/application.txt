Linkmint.co is a U.S.-based affiliate platform designed to help brands gain incremental exposure through ethical link-sharing. Our system allows verified users to create and share trackable smart links across social media, personal networks, and niche communities. Each transaction is tied directly to Rakuten’s reporting, ensuring full transparency and compliance with merchant rules. We do not use coupon sites, PPC bidding on brand terms, or unauthorized traffic sources. Linkmint’s mission is to expand your brand’s reach to micro-audiences that traditional affiliates may not cover, generating new customers at scale while respecting your program’s policies.


Focus on Networks That Allow Sub-Affiliates

CJ Affiliate was (and still is) the only big one open to you.

That was the Phase 1 fallback: start lean with CJ + direct merchants.

Direct Merchant Relationships

Reach out to Shopify/DTC brands and niche e-commerce sites.

Many don’t care about sub-affiliate restrictions → they just want sales.

Linkmint could become their “plug-and-play referral platform.”

Expand Into Non-Affiliate Referrals

Everyday referral codes (CashApp, Rakuten consumer, Webull, Ibotta, Upside).

These don’t require network approvals — anyone can share them.

Linkmint organizes them into a wallet → compliance-proof and viral.

Reframe the Pitch

Instead of “any link becomes a payout,” the safe fallback was:
👉 “Share approved deals + your own referrals, earn transparently with Linkmint.”

A subtle but critical pivot that keeps the viral + TrustScore logic intact without breaking network rules.

1. Direct Merchant Programs

Many DTC brands (Shopify stores, SaaS tools, niche e-commerce) run affiliate programs directly via in-house software (Post Affiliate Pro, ReferralCandy, PartnerStack).

Examples: Gymshark, Bluehost, NordVPN, Canva.

They don’t care if you’re a sub-affiliate network as long as you drive real sales.

👉 This is your fastest “add-on” path: email affiliate managers and integrate their programs into Linkmint.

2. Other Networks That Allow Sub-Affiliates

FlexOffers → already runs as a sub-affiliate network, and many merchants don’t object.

BrandCycle (Sovrn) → same, they broker for merchants.

Sovrn / Skimlinks → more automated but opaque; you’d be layering a sub-affiliate on top of a sub-affiliate, risky.

👉 FlexOffers is your closest “CJ alternative” at the network level

Two networks that are realistic & proven to accept:

FlexOffers → smaller brands, lifestyle, finance, travel.

Sovrn //Commerce (ex-VigLink) → auto-monetizes links, gives access to thousands of merchants.

Action:

Apply to FlexOffers + Sovrn.

Expect at least hundreds of merchants instantly from Sovrn once integrated.

👉 This adds instant breadth, even if commissions per merchant are small.

Good question 👍 when I wrote *“realistic for year 1 if you hustle outreach,”* I meant **you can’t just launch Linkmint and expect 1,000 users to show up**. You’ll need to **actively seed and recruit** your first wave of sharers.

Here’s what that “hustle outreach” looks like in practice:

---

## 🔹 1. Target the Right Early Adopters

Focus on groups that already like side hustles:

* **Reddit**: r/beermoney, r/sidehustle, r/WorkOnline.
* **Facebook Groups**: couponing, cashback, side hustles.
* **TikTok & YouTube**: micro-influencers talking about “ways to earn online.”
* **Discord communities**: side hustles, budget hacks, freelancing.

These users don’t need convincing that small commissions matter — they’re already looking.

---

## 🔹 2. Show Proof, Not Hype

* Share screenshots of *real pending → approved → payout* from your dashboard.
* Walk people through the 3 steps: **Copy link → Share → Earn.**
* Be honest about payout delay (30–60 days), but emphasize **“money you’d never earn otherwise.”**

---

## 🔹 3. Offer Small Referral Incentives

To speed things up:

* First 100 users → “Founders Badge” or slightly higher payout tier.
* Run referral bonuses: “Invite 3 friends who share → get \$5 PayPal.”
* These don’t require huge cash, but create buzz.

---

## 🔹 4. Post & Engage Daily (First 90 Days)

* Answer Reddit/TikTok/Discord threads *personally*.
* Share weekly “Top Deals” from your CJ roster → people start to expect content.
* Highlight user wins: “Sarah earned \$42 this week just by sharing links.”

---

## 🔹 5. KPIs to Track

* **User acquisition cost (UAC)**: How much effort/\$ it takes to onboard one new sharer.
* **Engagement**: % of users who share at least 5 links in first month.
* **Revenue per active user (RPAU)**: The average Linkmint margin per user.

---

⚡ In plain terms: *“hustle outreach” means you (or a small team) need to be the one **knocking on digital doors, showing proof, and hand-holding your first 100–200 users.***

If you do that consistently for a year, you’ll have enough data + cashflow to start automating user growth with ads or partnerships.

---

👉 Do you want me to **map out a 90-day “outreach playbook”** (specific daily/weekly actions, what to post where, what numbers to hit) so it’s crystal clear what Year 1 hustle actually looks like?

Alright — here’s what a **curated Linkmint model** would look like if you wanted to eventually play in Amazon/Rakuten’s league:

---

## 🔹 1. Shift From “Anyone Can Share” → “Approved Sharers”

* Instead of open signups, you create an **application or vetting process**.
* Users apply, you check:

  * Do they have an audience? (social accounts, group, community)
  * Are they compliant? (no spammy behavior)
* ✅ This matches how Amazon Influencer, LTK, and ShopStyle operate.

---

## 🔹 2. Brand-Safe Positioning

* Your pitch to merchants:

  * “We’re not a sub-affiliate free-for-all.”
  * “We hand-pick small creators who meet compliance.”
  * “We track fraud and handle payouts.”
* ✅ This makes Linkmint look like a *partner* instead of a risk.

---

## 🔹 3. Extra Value Layer

Merchants would ask: “Why not just work directly with affiliates?”
Your answer = **curation + tools**:

* Analytics: show merchants which sharers drive sales.
* Fraud shield: you review every user before approval.
* Easy access: merchants get 100s of micro-influencers at once.

---

## 🔹 4. Incentive for Users

* Users who don’t qualify for Amazon/Awin themselves could qualify for Linkmint.
* Example: A TikTok with 800 followers might get rejected by Amazon Influencer, but you’d approve them.
* ✅ Linkmint becomes the bridge.

---

## 🔹 5. Path to Amazon

* After 6–12 months of operating as a *curated micro-influencer platform*, you approach Amazon not as “sub-affiliate” but as:

  * “We are an influencer management layer.”
  * “We ensure only vetted accounts promote your products.”
* That’s exactly how **LTK (RewardStyle)** got in.

---

## 🔹 The Trade-Off

* ❌ You lose the **“anyone can earn” magic** that Linkmint started with.
* ✅ You gain a model that big brands will tolerate.
* ✅ Higher commissions possible because merchants trust curated traffic more.

---

👉 So basically:

* **Current Linkmint = Open / Everyday Sharers.**
* **Curated Linkmint (Amazon-compatible) = Micro-Influencer Gateway.**

Do you want me to run the math on how many curated users you’d need (and how much they’d earn) to make this a real business? That way you can compare *open vs curated* models side by side.
