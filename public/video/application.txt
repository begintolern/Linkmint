Linkmint.co is a U.S.-based affiliate platform designed to help brands gain incremental exposure through ethical link-sharing. Our system allows verified users to create and share trackable smart links across social media, personal networks, and niche communities. Each transaction is tied directly to Rakuten’s reporting, ensuring full transparency and compliance with merchant rules. We do not use coupon sites, PPC bidding on brand terms, or unauthorized traffic sources. Linkmint’s mission is to expand your brand’s reach to micro-audiences that traditional affiliates may not cover, generating new customers at scale while respecting your program’s policies.
