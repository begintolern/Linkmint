        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>
            Some links on our site and in our app are tracking links. If you click them
            and take a qualifying action, we may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Commissions are paid by advertisers/networks and do not increase your price.
