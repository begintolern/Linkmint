      <p>
        <strong>Linkmint</strong> participates in affiliate programs. This means we may earn a
        commission when users click links and complete qualifying actions (such as purchases or
        sign-ups) with partner advertisers or networks. There is <em>no additional cost</em> to you.
      </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>
            Some links on our site and in our app are tracking links. If you click them and take a
            qualifying action, we may receive a commission.
          </li>
          <li>Commissions are paid by advertisers/networks and do not increase your price.</li>

            Earnings shown in the dashboard are estimates until confirmed by the applicable
            advertiser or network and may be adjusted or reversed.

        <p>
          We aim to present accurate information and fairly represent partner offers. Compensation
          may influence placement or availability of offers, but it does not change our commitment

          Users may receive a portion of qualifying commissions according to our payout policy and
          any applicable program rules. Amounts are subject to advertiser/network confirmation,
          fraud checks, holdbacks, and compliance review.
